DevNet gets Membership changes from CDG
========================================
CDG Details page, replace Event log with:
	o ajax call to DevNet to get member details
	o display results



o Event endpoint:  .../events?names=<urn>,<urn>...&subject=<urn>
	o Each event has membership changes:  add=..., remove=...
	o Get 10 most recent



Object To URN
==============
  o Get  URI based on object type
  o Get OID
  o Generate URN

 URN to Object
 ==============
  o DevNet only URNs
  o Regex:  urn:devnet:<module>.<object_type>.oid
  	o parse, error if not match
  	o if oid not int, error
  	o if not "accounts", error
  	o validate object_type (user, org, company, territory)
  	o call URN converter($object_type, $oid)

  o Passed URN, return object

 o Find where we get Membership changes today in SecurityLog
 o Refactor to use service

 Flow:
 -----
 o Get events
 o ForEach event
 	o get add urns
 	o get remove urns
 	o foreach URN
 		o convert urn to DevNet account object
 		o generate member details (eg. user, org, company, territory name & details)


CLASSES:
	1. Call CDG to get events($event_types, subject)
	2. Process results: 
		o URN to Account object (user/org/company...)
		o Extract details from object



EventTypeMembershipChanged:  (interface)
	function translateEventData($event) {
		o replace Account URNs with Object refs
		o returns updated object
	}
	
EventLog class:
	o It knows where the EventLog service is and how to build a query

	getEvents:
		Passed query parms:
			o list of event types
			o subject
			o pagination
			o ... any other attribute filters that make sense

			o Response data:
				o replaces all DevNet URNs with object refs
